// Scheduler Syntax.**
When you want to use your own scheduler policy*, you have to specify at every step which process has the hand.
So if you want to load a scheduler you have to write a text file with the following syntax :
	1)	In the first line you write the number of process which are running you algorithm
	2)	At every line you write the ID of the process that has the hand
	3) 	To simulate a crash, use "!" before the number of the process.

If at the end of the file all the processes have not finished the execution (or are crashed), a loop is made.
It is important to note nothing guaranteed that the simulation will finish. 

You can see an example of the scheduler format, in the text file sampleScheduler.txt

To generate those files, you can at the end of the simulation save the last execution, "Scheduler->Save last execution".
