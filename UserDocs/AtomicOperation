	2) .write(x)		: Write x in the shared register
	
	3) .update(x)		: Write x in the shared array at the position i (i=index of the process)
	4) .snapshot()		: Return the value of the shared array
	
	5) .enqueue(x)		: Add the value x on queue of the shared queue
	6) .dequeue()		: Return and removed the value at the tail of the shared queue
