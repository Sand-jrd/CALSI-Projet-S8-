How To Launch Your Simulation.

To launch the execution, first load (or write) your algorithm on the tab "Original Code". To load your algorithm, use the tab "File->Open..."
Make sure this file respect the rules describe in HowToWriteYourCode. 
Then you have to choose your scheduler policy with "Scheduling Policy". You have the choice between "Random, StepByStep and with File".
Unless you choose "With file", you have then to specify the number of process in your simulation in "Number of processes" at the right of the Window. 

After those settings, you can launch the simulation clicking on "New Execution".
Once launch, you can use the button "+step" to execute one step. 
The scheduler will then choose a process and execute a step, all the value of local and shared variables will be updated.
The button "-step" allow you to go back one step before.**

At the end of the simulation you can then save the last execution, "Scheduler->Save last execution". To know more about the format of those file read HowToWriteYourScheduler

** The feature "-step" is not yet implemented
